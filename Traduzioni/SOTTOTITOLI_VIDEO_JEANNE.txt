fortitude, strike them all down!



Scene 20: Sentanced to Burn

Man: ...that the woman known as Jeanne La Puccelle did willfully and in modesty cut her hair 
and adapt the attire of a man, and continually so dishonoring the world through her 
bloodthirsty nature. Moreover she has rejected the laws of the church, choosing to submit 
herself only to her false visions of God.

Liane: I never commited any such crime!

Man: For this pernicious, sinful acts against our faith she shall hereby be denounced
and declared an apostate of the church and heretic. Good Christians of war, see what 
before you this fine sorceress who declared herself to be your savior!

Bedford: Heh heh

like ants without a hill! It makes me want to go out there and squish one of them!

Even to the darkest corners of the earth.

awesome power! Humans, your fate lies before the toes of a giant! 




Scene 29: Prayers (The last scene)

Prince Henry: Thanks to you, I can finally return to my home in England! I 
wish I could repay you...

Jeanne: Just make a promise to take good care of all of your subjects.

La Hire: They do need you, little king.

Prince Henry: Right! I promise I will! But... *cries*

Prince Henry: Farewell Jeanne!

Englishmen: Farewell! Cheers!

Gilles: So I suppose this is where we all part ways...

Jeanne: Sadly the village is not going to rebuild itself.

Roger: Domremy will one day rise up from the ashes, in honor of the brave souls 
who died protecting it.

La Hire: Oh, La Hire will miss his General. If things ever get hairy again...

Gilles: And what could be hairier than you, my friend?

*all laugh*

Jeanne: Um, Gilles...

Gilles: Yes Jeanne?

Jeanne: The gem... Are you going to be allright?

Gilles: Yes I will be just fine. This I am taking all the way to the grave.

sure to chomp him back to his senses! *chomps*

*Gilles laughs*

Jeanne: Then I will lay my fears to rest. Well, goodbye my dear friends

Gilles: Adieu

La Hire: Fare thee well dear child.

Richard: May the good lord watch over you always.

Jeanne: Hmm! Roger, let us go home.

Roger: Yes.

Gilles: It is a good thing we stuck with Jeanne, no?

La Hire: Eye!

Richard: That young lady is a true emisary sent by the lord.

Jeanne's father: Jeanne you have finally returned home, and you even 
brought Roger with you like I asked! Well, it took you long enough!

Jeanne: Oh! Papa thank god you are alive!

Jeanne's father: Yes, and I hear you've been quite busy saving France for us. 
That's my daughter! You've made your father a very proud man, I hope you know that.

Jeanne: Papa! *cries*

Villager: Look here! They have come home!

Jeanne: But papa, how did you escape when the English attacked? 

Jeanne's father: We owe that to the insoles(?) at the festival, and they 
loaded us into their wagons and took us to safety.

Jeanne: *sigh* I still cannot believe it.

Roger: It is a second chance for us, Jeanne, to make sure Domremy never sees another day of war.

*after credits*

Jeanne: Liane...
